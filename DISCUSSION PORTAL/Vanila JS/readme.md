## User story 1 : 
Your page should be divided in two parts.The right pane, by default, contains a question form with mandatory field title & question. The left pane is initially empty but should contain a list of questions.

## User Story 2 : 
When the question form in the right pane is submitted, add a question to the left pane.

## User Story 3 : 
When a question box in the left pane is clicked, display the question, the response form, and the responses in the right pane. Response form contains Name & Comment field (Both are mandatory).

There should be a "Resolve" button, below the question segment.

## User Story 4 : 
When you submit the response, that should be appended in Responses.

## User Story 5 : 
When the answer form is submitted, append an answer to the “Previous Answers” section.

## User Story 6: 
On the left side after the "New Question" button a search box is present. When the search input tag is edited, filter the questions in the left pane to only those that match the search terms. 
**Remove all filtering if the search input becomes empty.**

## User Story 7: 
Add a count associated with each question or each response that represents how many up-votes it has (negative numbers correspond to downvotes). Add buttons that allow the user to up and down vote questions or responses. 
**Display questions/responses with more upvotes earlier than questions/responses with fewer upvotes.**

## User Story 8: 
When the resolve button is clicked, remove the associated question from the question list. Make the right pane display the new question form.

## Add Timers in Discussions

You'll need to add a timer with questions and responses, which shows how old your questions and responses were. In the screenshot below, after the question, a timeline indicates which updates in real-time.

## Mark question as a favorite

Add a favorite button associated with each question or each response. Display questions that are favorited before other questions in the question listing. Favorited questions should have a star (or some other symbol) indicating that they have been favorited.
